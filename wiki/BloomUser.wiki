bloom-user extends the User model much like profiles do, to contain phone numbers

= Introduction =
bloom-user is very similar to a profile.  Profiles only allow a 1 to 1 relationship with users and profiles, since a user may have more than one phone number (home, mobile, second mobile,etc) bloom.user could not be made into a profile.  Otherwise bloom.user looks very much like a standard profile.

The 2 functions that exist in bloom.user.utils are get_or_create_user_by_phone_number and get_or_create_user_by_email.
Their names make what they do pretty self evident.
It allows petals like bloom.share to always associate a sharedlink with a user object for the sharer and sharee.

The only overhead to this is that when registering new users you have to check to see if they already have an entry into the system,
either an existing email or phone_number.

If you do not find one, then create the user as usual.  If you find a match, then you can simply take the existing user object and fill in the blank fields and set the is_active value to True.

All accounts that are created automatically by bloom.user are set to is_active = False, this way you can track activity with non-registered users, but they cannot login until they create proper accounts.
