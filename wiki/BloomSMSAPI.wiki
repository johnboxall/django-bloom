{{{
send_sms(message, recipient_list):

	a wrapper function around SendSMS.send_sms.
	It takes care of creating the SendSMS object and calls SendSMS.send_sms for you.

	You should only need to do it manually if you want to do something more complex than just send an SMS.

	returns the status of each sent message as a list.  
	(ie: the first response in the list matches up to the first number in the recipient list)
	Note: most SMS providers will return a positive status if the api call was successful, however this is not indicative of the status of the 		      actual message.
