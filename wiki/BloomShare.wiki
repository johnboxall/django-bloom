bloom-share lets you shorten urls so that they are more easily shared on character restricted mediums.

= Introduction =
bloom-share shortens urls by storing the full url in a database and doing lookups on request then redirecting to the proper url.  bloom-share exists because SMS message are only permitted to contain 140 characters, so longer/complex urls would consume too many characters in an SMS message.
